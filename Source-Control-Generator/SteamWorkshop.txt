[h1][b]Declutter Skill-Panel[/b][/h1]
[h1]Divinity Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition[/h1]
<hr>
Remove undesirable skills from your skill-panel. Are you playing with 15 class-mods that add several hundred new abilities? Do you find yourself repeatedly respeccing every hour trying to find the perfect build? You thought Flaming-Skin was super edgy but it turned out to be hot-garbage?, Not only were you scammed, it also has left a permanent mark in your spellbook to constantly remind you of your blunder?
Chances are, your skill-panel is FUBAR and needs some [i]declutterin'[/i]. Well, I've got just what you need.

[h1]Background[/h1]
I don't like respeccing much and I don't use class-mods. But even then the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics dictates that my skill-panel eventually ends up in a state of ungodly disarray. I also don't put attribute points into memory (prefer scrolls) and think it's as bad as putting points in constitution. So I end up switching skills a lot in preparation of upcomming battles (though I do enjoy managing limited-use items and pre-battle planning as a game-mechanic). This forces me to look at the utter mess that the skill-panel becomes as the game progresses. This problem is accentuated by skills like Haste and Teleport that are extremely useful to have but become so abundantly available as scrolls that you don't ever need to slot them post-driftwood. But they sit there in your skill-panel clogging up visual space. This mod will let you selectively remove those skills from your character and tidy up the skill-panel.

[h1]Features[/h1]
The mod adds a unique artefact known as the [i][b]"Forgetinator"[/b][/i] that is able to selectively purge memories from the user. You can find it in one of the torture-rooms in Fort Joy Dungeons. It will also be added to your inventory automatically if you never picked it up, dropped it somewhere or have otherwise moved-on from Fort Joy.

How to use this mod:

[olist]
[*]Save your game before you go purging any skills.
[*]Open your skill-panel (default: K) and hit "Reset-All" or manually remove all memorized skills. (you can leave the ones you wish to remove memorized).
[*]Memorize only the skills that you wish to permanently remove from the character. Double-check.
[*]Use the Forgetinator from your inventory. BANG! Just fire and forget, literally.
[*]Make sure you don't regret what you've done. Reload if you do.
[/olist]
Works on mod-added skills too. Purge 'em ALL!!!
Innate skills and skills granted by items are not removed since that would be stupid. i.e. You cannot reacquire them.
